			<span>'I Learneds What?' is an add-on that informs the player what they have unlocked as they level. It expands on the game's existing information by grouping all unlocks in one location and offering even more variety.
		  </span>
			<span>For that, the add-on provides information about following unlock types:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
					Abilities and passives
					</td>
					<td>
					Riding skills
					</td>
					<td>
					Talent points
					</td>
					<td>
					Zones
					</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					<td>
					Dungeons and raids
					</td>
					<td>
					PvP battlegrounds
					</td>
					<td>
					UI features
					</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
		</span>
			<span>
				It also allows the player to filter out different types of unlocks, in case they aren't interested in those.
		  </span>
			  <span>
				The end goal is to improve on Blizzard's default UI, and making the player more engaged and exited about leveling and the unlocks that come with it.
		  </span>
			  <span>
				Thanks to community translators, there is Korean and Traditional Chinese localization.

			<span>'I Learned What?' has its roots from Wildstar. If you leveled up in Wildstar, you can open a window that informs you about new content you unlocked. This would be content such as new abilities you can learn, or if you can start questing in a new zone.
		  </span>
			  <span>I liked this feature a lot. Not only was it helpful if you were new to the game, it also felt like opening a present every time you leveled up. In addition, if you open it while on your way to the next level, it will show you what will be in store for you in the upcoming levels.

			  For comparison, if you level up in World of Warcraft, some limited information is posted in the chat window. In later expansions this was improved to show a list of newly unlocked content at the top of the screen, which fades out after a brief moment.
		    </span>
			  <span>
			My goal was to provide a wider variety of unlocked content, bring all of it together in a clear overview, and allow the player to read through it at their own pace.
		    </span>
			  <span>
				  In addition, I wanted to inform the player of what is awaiting them at upcoming levels. Informing the player when the next unlock happens gives them a clear goal to work towards. Offering them an overview of all the level unlocks gives them a clear view of their progression. How far have they come and what is yet in store.
				 </span>
			  <span>
				  Another issue is specializations. If a player levels in specialization A, they will be informed about the spells they learns along the way, slowly building up their toolkit. If the player then changes to specialization B at a higher level, they just get all the spells they should have learned, with no progression attached.

			 One of the most important pieces to get this addon to work, is the need for data. If I want to inform the player what they unlocked, the addon needs to know as well.
				 </span>
			  <span>
				It would be possible to just catch the data the game already gives to the player, but that would just limit our data. We would get abilities, but I wouldn't get information about new zones, or if certain elements of the UI become available.
			 </span>
			   <span>
			  There is also no official API that I can ask what is unlocked at each level. So in the end I had to create my own database by searching through different fansites for data, and official interface art for matching icons.
			  </span>
			  <span>
				  The first version worked, but was a nightmare to maintain because of the amount of data that had to manually be typed in. With a later rework I figured I could get a fair amount of data, such as if a spell is passive or a higher rank, through API. Not only made the rework the data easier to maintain, it also cut down the amount of data that has to be stored in memory, made it possible to include unlocks exclusive to factions and races, and made localization a lot more plausible.

				The actual layout of the addon was pretty straight forward at first. I wanted to display the unlocks in a simple list so you could go through them one by one.
			</span>
			  <span>
				For looks, I based it on the in-game spellbook which uses an icon that makes a visual difference between each spell, a title, and subtext. These were perfect for displaying an unlock, and with some aligning I made room for a level indicator to seperate the unlocks of different levels.
		  </span>
			<span>
				I wanted the list to be more than just images giving you information, so I added functionality to the icons. Asside from showing some text in the tooltip, clicking on a spell allows you to put it on your hotbar, dungeons open the dungeon journal to the correct page, zones open the map of that zone, and so on.
		  </span>	
			  <span>
				In addition I wanted to make it less confusing to switch specializations while leveling. If you go from A to B at level 20, and then back to A at level 50, you don't really know with what progression you should have learned all the spells you missed between level 20 and 50. The add-on will show you all these spells grouped by level, so they can see at what level it was thrown in the mix, to give a better idea of how it should tie in with what they already knew.

				  During the rework I wanted to add a sort of graph that would show the player's leveling progress. Both a look at the past, and a look at the future of how much more there was to come, or how close they are to end-game. And if the unlocks of the next level isn't too interesting to them, they can find an interesting goal further down the line instead.
				   </span>
			  <span> I decided to go with the looks of an experience bar, where every level was a block that could light up when they reached the level, and had a number to show the amount of unlocks would be happening at that level. It also has some small quality of life features. As such, it will try to default to 5 levels lower, so you always get a feeling of progression, while still being able to see 10 levels ahead. The scroll bar at the bottom also has a line going through it, which shows the overall progression from level 1 all the way to endgame. This also makes it easier return to your current progression in the graph.
