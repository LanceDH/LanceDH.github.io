       <span>Greetings. My name is Nikos Vanden Broek, and I live in Antwerp, Belgium. I am currently a third, and final, year student at <a href="http://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/" target="_blank">Digital Arts and Entertainment</a>.
        Games have been part of my childhood from a relatively young age. Over the years I became more and more interested about everything going on behind the scenes. As I grew up, so did my passion for game development. Starting with map editors, and later moving on to add-ons for World of Warcraft, and actual engines like Unity. Be it gameplay mechanics, user interfaces, an FPS level, or boss fight. There's a challenge, and I want to try to overcome it.
        I enjoy creating things that help, entertain or improve the gameplay experience for players, and listening to their feedback or what they liked, or what could be improved.
        Of course, besides making them, I still like to actually play different games. Having moments to play together with friends, and just have a laugh and a good time.</span> </div>

      <div class="tileText"> <span>Outside the digital space, I adore Archery. Nothing fancy like a compound bow or even a scope, just straight up instinctive archery.</span> <span>Freeing your mind and having your instincts take over offers a great counterbalance to the constant thinking when programming.</span> <span>Sadly, due to being on the other side of the country for college, I had to take a break from archery. However, I'm absolutely looking to pick it back up once I have the chance!</span> </div>

Motivated and enthusiastic co-workers who enjoy working with each other as friends. And the opportunity to take your mind off of work during a break.</span> </div>
