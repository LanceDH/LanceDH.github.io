      <div class="tileText"> <span>As of August 2016, Lore Library has been discontinued. This page explains the creation and reasoning behind the discontinuation in greater detail.</span> <span>Keeping it short; there is currently a lack of official API to support a project of this type and scale. To get around this, all lore text has to be obtained through third party websites, for every localization. This data can often be incomplete or missing, and has to constantly be loaded in memory. As a result the high upkeep didn't fit my available time.</span> <span>Despite the discontinuation, the project has shown that there is an interesting in an add-on like Lore Library. If better API support every becomes available, or I can find the time and a way to rework the add-on to require less upkeep, I would gladly revive it.</span> </div>

      <div class="tileText"> <span>Warcraft contains over 20 years of lore, years before the launch of World of Warcraft. A lot of newer players aren't familiar with all this backstory. If they are interested in learning these stories, they would have to go back to play the old games, read through novels, or rely on third party websites.</span> <span>One of the main ideas for Lore Library was getting this lore available to the player in-game. For example, if a player meets a major lore character, they could search the library to learn about their backstory.</span> <span>Part of the idea came from the Tome of Knowledge in Warhammer Online. This tome was a collection of things the player had done, their questlog, achievements, important NPCs, bestiary, lore, and much more.</span> <span>Although I've had this concept for a project for a while, it wasn't a number one priority because of the amount of work required. A conversation on Reddit was what eventually caused the spark to get things started. Rather than the expansive pool of lore, they were talking about storing the in-game books that players can read. So the project was a lot more manageable in scale ... or at least so I thought.</span> </div>

    <h2>The thought process</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">
    <div class="frontTile " style="height:auto" >
      <div class="tileText"> <span>The first thing that needed to be done was to figure out the available API functions that could help create the add-on. Unlike other parts of the UI, the API for item text is very limited. What the player is reading, when they are reading something, and the title of what they are reading is about all we can gather.</span> <span>So there is no unique identifier to what the player is reading, other than the title. The issue with this, is that the game supports multiple languages. As a result, a single piece of text has seven different identifiers. Luckily we only need to load one language at a time, but with over 600 pieces of text, it's a lot of work to set up the data.</span> <span>As mentioned before, there is no way of getting the text other than the exact moment the player is reading it. It would be possible to keep the text stored once read, but then players would have to go back to read books they've read before. As some text is received during quests, it would also no longer be possible for them to reobtain those pieces.</span> <span>Instead, I decided to get the information from a third party website. As you could imagine, going through every book quickly proved to be a nightmare. Instead I decided to spend some time to write two tools in c# that could scrape the pages for me, and handle the translations.</span> <span>Although it sped up the work a lot, it wasn't without issues. As the data on these sites are generated by data from the users, a lot of them are either not translated, or just completely missing because it's too early in an expansion or major patch.</span> <span>Another issue is the exact reason we use unique IDs. There's only a name to identify text with, but names aren't always unique. Sometimes a letter with the same name, can have two different versions depending on the player's faction. Other items might just have a generic name like 'Dusty Journal', or different text depending on the player's progression. All of these still required manual work to fix.</span> </div>

    <div class="frontTile " style="height:auto" >
      <div class="centerDiv"> <img src="../images/LoreLibrary/story2.jpg" alt="c# tool"  onClick="GalleryZoom(this)" /> <br/>
        <span class="imgSubscript"><span>c# tools helped speed up the workload, however are now outdated as the webpages updated over the years.</span> </span> </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">
    <div class="frontTile " style="height:auto" >
      <div class="tileText"> <span>With all the texts done, there was still the task of informing the player where to obtain each piece of lore. This once again proved to be a massive amount of work to get every source per text. 
        These sources could be dropped by an NPC, come from pickpocketing, bought from a vendor, part of a quest, completely unavailable, or simply located out in the world.</span> <span>This last one might seem straight forward, but some text can be found across eight different zones. To cut down the work for that one, I decided to simply limit them to a single zone, with the only exception being text found in faction specific territory.</span> <span>To solve the issue of lore unavailable to the player, I decided to implement a currency called 'lost pages'. After the player discovered a number of texts, they would receive one of these pages. These pages could then be used to unlock one of the unavailable pieces.</span> <span>This might seem the end of it, but there was still the issue of localization. I could tell the player a text dropped from a certain NPC, but that NPC would have a different name in a different language. So I decided to give localized sources a custom ID by combining a prefix of the type, with the ID of the source. To handle the translations I created another tool in c# that would find the source using this custom ID on the localized version of the third party website.</span> </div>

      <div class="tileText"> <span>After I gathered all the data and their sources, I then wanted to mark books found in the world on the world map. This way players could see if there is one nearby, and unlock it while they're there.</span> <span>Inspiration from this came from Guild Wars 2. There you could complete a zone by completing quests, unlocking waypoints, and discovering points of interest. Doing so would reward the player with a loot chest.</span> <span>I can't reward the player, but going around a zone to unlock all the books and watching your progression go up is still enjoyable to a lot of players.</span> <span>Taking this idea I added a small progress indicator to the corner of the map. This informs the player how close they are to having found all the books in the zone, and gives a good feeling once they finally do so. In addition, if the player hovered over the indicator it would highlight all the undiscovered books in the zone. This can help them if they have a hard time spotting some of the book icons on the map.</span> </div>

      <div class="tileText"> <span>Having the basic add-on done and released to the public, I was looking to expand it further with more lore features. With Guild Wars 2 zone completion in mind, I wanted to teach players about areas in the world they might now know about.</span> <span>I decided to pick out interesting spots in each zones that either had some lore, or something interesting to look at which the player might have missed. These places would be marked on the map, just like the lore books, and if the player got close enough, they would unlock the associated lore. Once a player unlocked all the spots in a zone, they would unlock even more lore about the zone as a whole.</span> <span>While being a great idea, and proving fun after some testing, it quickly became clear it would be nearly impossible to complete on my own.</span> <span>To get lore for each of these locations, I once again had to rely on third party websites. The added issue, was that all this lore was written by many different people. As a result they all had different styles to them, making it so they didn't fit well together, ended up short, were incomplete, or incorrect.</span> <span>In addition, I had to manually scout out every zone for interesting locations, resulting in too much work to do alone. With all the work required to keep the base of Lore Library up to date, it sadly wasn't feasible to add any major features such as this one.</span> </div>
